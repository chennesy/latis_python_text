    "## The Bag-of-Words Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of bag-of-words (BoW), as the name suggests, is quite intuitive: we take a document and toss it in a bag. The action of \"throwing\" the document in a bag disregards relative position between words, so what is \"in the bag\" is essentially an unsorted set of words [(Jurafsky & Martin, 2024, p.62)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf). In return, we have a list of unique words and the frequency of each of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as shown in the following illustration, the word \"coffee\" appears twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='bow-illustration-1.png' alt=\"BoW-Part2\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have realized now, with a bag-of-words representation, we make heavy use of word frequency but not too much of word order. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of sentiment analysis, the sentiment of a tweet is conveyed more strongly by specific words. For example, if a tweet contains the word \"happy\", it likely conveys positive sentiment, but not always (e.g., \"not happy\" denotes the opposite sentiment). When these words come up more often, they'll probably more strongly convey the sentiment."

    "## Document Term Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the idea of bag-of-words. Before we go deep into that, let's step back for a moment. In practice, text analysis often involves handling many documents; from now on, we use the term **document** to indicate a piece of text that we perform analysis on. It could be a phrase, a sentence, a tweet, and etc, as long as it could be represented by a string of text, the length dosen't really matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have four documents (i.e., the four phrases shown above), we toss them all in the bag. Instead of a word-frequency list, we would expect a document-term matrix (DTM) in return. In a DTM, the word list is the **vocabulary** (V) that holds all unique words occur across the documents. For each **document** (D), we count the number of occurence of each word in the vocabulary, and then plug the number into the matrix. In other words, the DTM we will need to construct is a $D \\times V$ matrix, where each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a token (or \"term\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the unique tokens in this set of documents, in alphabetical order, are in columns. For each document, we mark the occurence of each word showing up in the document. The numerical representation for each document is a row in the matrix. For example, \"the coffee roaster\" or the first document has numerical representation $[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]$.\n",

    "When people refer to word vectors, or word embeddings, they're talking about a way of representing each word as a numerical vector in a high-dimensional space, typically from 50 to 300 dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of word vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimensionality: In TF-IDF there as many dimensions as there are words in the vocabulary. Word vectors typically have fewer dimensions (e.g., 100 or 300).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Density: Unlike TF-IDF where a vector consists mostly of 0s, word vectors are dense, meaning most elements are non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learned from data: Word vectors are typically learned from large text corpora using machine learning techniques. They capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words based on their usage patterns in the text. The relationships between the words come entirely from the text corpora they were trained on - not from your documents!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Semantic relationships: Similar words have similar vectors. For example, the vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\" might be close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Arithmetic operations: Word vectors often exhibit interesting arithmetic properties. A classic example is: vector(\"king\") - vector(\"man\") + vector(\"woman\") ≈ vector(\"queen\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Word Vectors Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors work on the principle of distributional semantics, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. Machine learning models analyze large amounts of text data to learn these representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different popular models out there, such as Word2Vec, developed by Google. We'll stick with spaCy, and use the vector model that comes with \"en_core_web_md\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about how these models produce meaningful word embeddings, and how the models are trained, see the Carpentries' lesson on [the Word2Vec algorithm](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-text-analysis/08-wordEmbed_word2vec-algorithm/index.html). "

    "## Semantic search & vector databases\n",
    "In this section we will create a vector database with many State of the Union documents, and query it semantically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Vector Databases?\n",
    "Vector databases are specialized storage and retrieval systems designed to handle high-dimensional vector data efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that work with structured data like numbers and text, vector databases are optimized for managing and querying vector embeddings - numerical representations of data points in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, vector databases address the challenge of similarity search in large datasets. They excel at finding the most similar items to a given query, which is crucial for applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing. For instance, in a vector database storing product information, you could easily find similar products based on various attributes, all encoded as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of vector databases lies in their ability to perform fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches. Traditional databases might struggle with the \"curse of dimensionality\" when dealing with high-dimensional data, but vector databases employ specialized indexing techniques to maintain efficiency. This makes them particularly useful for AI and machine learning applications, where data is often represented in high-dimensional vector spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those new to the concept, you can think of a vector database as a system that organizes information in a way that mirrors how our brains associate related concepts. Just as we can quickly recall words or images that are similar to a given prompt, vector databases can rapidly retrieve data points that are \"close\" to each other in a mathematical sense. This capability opens up exciting possibilities for creating more intelligent and intuitive data-driven applications across various domains."

    "BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used in information retrieval systems, particularly in search engines. It's an advanced form of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) that provides a way to rank documents based on their relevance to a given search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 improves upon simpler ranking methods by incorporating document length normalization. This means it can account for the fact that longer documents are more likely to contain a given term simply due to their length, rather than because of relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm calculates a score for each document based on the query terms it contains. It considers both how often a term appears in a document (term frequency) and how rare the term is across all documents (inverse document frequency). However, it also applies a saturation function to prevent common terms from dominating the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those new to information retrieval, BM25 can be thought of as a way of determining which documents in a collection are most relevant to a user's search query. It's widely used in practice due to its effectiveness and relatively simple implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at how we can implement BM25 in Python using a DataFrame's 'speeches' field.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we first need to tokenize our text. We could use `nlp()` to use our spaCy model from earlier, but that would be quite time consuming. To save time let's just split our documents up by whitespace. "
